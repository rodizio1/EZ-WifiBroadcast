# EZ-WifiBroadcast
Affordable Digital HD Video Transmission made easy!

The goal of this project is to make the usage of Befinitiv's Wifibroadcast (https://befinitiv.wordpress.com/wifibroadcast-analog-like-transmission-of-live-video-data/) easy for people who would be otherwise drawn away because it can become quite time consuming and frustrating setting everything up if not used to tinkering with linux. Just download the SD card image, put it on two SD cards, switch everything on and 15 seconds later you'll see a live HD picture.
